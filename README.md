# Car Catalog Website

This project is a car catalog website built using Next.js and TypeScript. It serves as a practical application of the concepts learned from the tutorial available on YouTube: [Building a Car Catalog with Next.js and TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUNSHPyVryU&t=9217s).

## Overview

The website fetches car data from the [Cars by API-Ninjas](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/cars-by-api-ninjas?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel) API through RapidAPI. Additionally, car images are sourced from [Imagin Studio](https://www.imagin.studio/solutions/api).

## Features

- **Car Catalog:** View a comprehensive catalog of cars with detailed information.
- **Filtering:** Filter cars based on various criteria such as make, model, and year.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to provide a seamless experience across different devices.
